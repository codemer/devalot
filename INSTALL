= Installng Devalot

These instructions should get you up and running.  For further information,
please visit the Devalot website:

    http://projects.noscience.net/devalot


== Getting The Source

Download a tarball from http://files.noscience.net/pub/devalot/files.
E.g.,

    wget http://files.noscience.net/pub/devalot/files/devalot-rel-0.1.tar.bz2
    tar xvjf devalot-rel-0.1.tar.bz2


== Preparing The Database

Before you begin, make sure you have your database server up and running.
Since Devalot uses the Ruby on Rails framework, you can use any database that
the ActiveRecord library supports, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, or even SQLite. 

Using your database administration tools, create a database named 'devalot'.
If you plan on doing development on devalot, you should also create
'devalot_test' and 'devalot_dev' databases.  Once you have the database
created, copy the config/database.yml.sample file in the Devalot source to
config/database.yml:

    cp config/database.yml.sample config/database.yml

Use your favorite text editor to change the database connection settings to
match the settings for the 'devalot' database you just created.

Now you can create all the necessary tables, and insert the default data:

    rake db:migrate
    ruby script/setup


== Starting the Web Server

You can start the built-in web server using the following command:

    ruby script/server production


== Final Steps

* Point your web browser at http://localhost:3000/account/login
* Login with 'admin@localhost.local' as the username and 'admin_pass' as the password
* Change the admin password!
* Review the settings in http://localhost:3000/admin
* You can change your site name in the admin area, under "Policies"
* Did you change the admin password?
