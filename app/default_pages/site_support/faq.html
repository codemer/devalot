h2. Q: How do I create an account?

A: If the site administrator has enabled new account creation you can go to
the "login page":/account/login and click "Register For a New Account".


h2. Q: What does it mean that my account is moderated?

A: In order to keep spam to a minimum, new accounts start out with zero
points, meaning they are moderated.  

As soon as a moderator reviews your content, you will be promoted to a Level
2 user and your content will no longer be moderated.  See [[Moderation Levels]]
for a list of levels.


h2. Q: This is a pretty cool application, can I install my own copy?

A: You sure can!  Head over to the main <r:devalot/> project page.
