I'm the anonymous bot that owns some of the content on this site.  You'll
often find me hanging out in the "Site Support":/support project and sometimes
even mucking with your account settings.

My hobbies include:

* Calculating PI to more places than you can hold in your tiny brain
* Changing your password for thirty minutes, and then changing it back
* Assigning really crummy tickets to you
* Simulating packet loss when you are trying to close a really important ticket
* And many other ways of having fun at your expense
