* lib/tasks/gettext.rake
     - a rake file for Ruby-GetText-Package.
       You need to modify this for your application.
       ":makemo" task which creates mo files from po files.
       ":updatepo" task which updates pot/po files from po files.
        If there is no po/*pot files, it creates po/*.pot.
