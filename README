= Welcome to Devalot

Devalot is a social networking application centered around software projects.
It connects the user community with the development community and encourages
participation, and communication.

Within Devalot you'll find all the features you've come to expect in modern
web-based applications such as tagging, comments, and a wiki, as well as
features you'd expect in project tracking software such as ticketing.  

These are just a few of Devalot's features, and many more are planned.  

You can help mature Devalot and make it a better product by contributing
financially to the project.  Please visit the website for more information.
